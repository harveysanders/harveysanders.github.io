    ==== SECTION 2: HTML & JavaScript ====
      
      EXERCISE 1:

      1) Inside of your HTML, create a bunch of `div` tags with random content of your choice. Give some of the divs a class name of `more-important`.
      1) Use querySelectorAll to return an array of all the `more-important` divs and store them in a variable named `allImportantDivs`.
      3) Log `allImportantDivs` to the console and observe the result.
      4) Create an array with the name `divContents`.
      5) Loop over `allImportantDivs` and add the textContent of each `div` to the array `divContents`.
      6) Outside of the loop, log the `divContents` array to the console and observe the contents.

      EXERCISE 2:

      1) Create an array with 5 strings containing sentences of your choice.
      2) In your HTML, create an unordered list with 5 empty list items tags.
      3) Use querySelectorAll to select each `li` inside of your list and store the result in a variable named `myList`.
      4) Loop over each `li` in `myList` and update the textContent to a random index in your array of strings. (HINT: Math.random())
      5) Observe your page update dynamically with random content.
      6) EXTRA CREDIT: Figure out how to avoid duplicate list items.
      7) EXTRA CREDIT: Allow the user to press a button to re-shuffle the strings

      EXTRA CREDIT EXERCISE:

      Fill an empty <ul> with a collection of <li> elements containing text using innerHTML.

    ==== SECTION 3: Get your wheels spinning ====

      1) Why might storing data in an array be useful?
      
      2) What is the difference between innerHTML and textContent?
